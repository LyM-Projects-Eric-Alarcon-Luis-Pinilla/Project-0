Run The Code:

The file console.py is the file you should run to test the program.

Important Features:

FOR LOADING A TEXT FILE:
In order to test the code, please upload in the folder "Data" the txt file you want to check. As well, the tokenizer used was Regex, hence is necesary to install it in order for the program to work. In the folder you will find an example named 
prueba.txt that shows a correct example. In the view the name you need to introduce is only the name of the file for example
prueba.txt.

CONSIDERATIONS OF THE CODE:

1. For the assignment simple command, the name of the variable had to be previously
stated in a defvar block. Else it would be considered an error becaus it wasnt declared or intialized before.

2. The name of the variables, parameters and defprock blocks are a sequence of alphanumeric characters where the
firs character can not be a number. For example: {var1num} is a valid name, but {1varnum} is not a valid name.

3. The if command should always have an else, in other words an only if syntax is considered an error.

4. Simplecommands should always be inside a defProc function or inside a block of commands {}, hence there cannot
be simplecommands alone or outside a structure as it would be considered an error.
